Release 1.1 (March 11, 2011)
----------------------------------------

New features:
- tool ReadStats: generates a statistic about the read alignments and
the covered genes

Other changes:
- prctiles.m: replaced function by own implementation
- ParseGFF.py: now parses also non-coding transcripts; exons
coordinates always in ascending order (for both strands)

Bug fixes:
- get_reads: fixed a memory leak and segmentation faults
- sanitise_genes.m: adapted to closed intervals in gene structure from
ParseGFF.py
- rquant_core.m: corrected initialisation of transcript length bins


Release 1.0 (December 17, 2010)
----------------------------------------

This is the first release of the quantitation tool rQuant, which
determines abundances of multiple transcripts per gene locus from
RNA-Seq measurements.
