The five files contain example data from one 1 MB regions from the C. elegans genome.
(This is one of the regions that have been defined in the nGASP project, see http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/549)

The five files are:
* the genomic sequences in FASTA format
* the genome annotation in GFF3 format
* a small set of aligned reads in SAM format (generated with genomemapper/qpalma)
* a pre-learned density model for the transcript profiles
* a pre-learned density model for the intron distances
