To setup rQuant, please follow these steps:

1. Download the SAMTools (version 0.1.7) from http://samtools.sourceforge.net/ and install it. You need to add the flag -fPIC in the SAMTools Makefile for compilation.
2. Add the SAMTools directory to ./mex/Makefile, go to ./mex and run make ('make octave' for Octave and 'make matlab' for Matlab).
3. If you would like to use Mosek as the optimization software, please install it by following the intructions in mosek/README. Otherwise, there is the option of using the optimizer "loqo" that is already integrated in the rQuant package. 
4. Run ./setup_rquant.sh and setup paths and configuration options for rQuant.

Optional
5. Download the example data with ./get_data.sh in ./examples.
6. Run an example by executing ./run_example.sh with input 'small' or 'big' to work on a small (55 examples) and big (1865 examples) C. elegans data set, respectively in the examples directory.
